                <h3>Q: What drives you to get up every morning?</h3>
                <p>A: The thing that drives me to get up every morning is the fact that I need to do well in school, so that I can get a nice job
                    and live well on my own without issues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: What Goal are you working toward right now?</h3>
                <p>A: I working toward getting my Associates degree in Software Engineering. As of now I know the following programming languages: Python, C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, and a very small amount of JavaScript.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: What's your favorite type of cuisine?</h3>
                <p>A: I would have to say my favorite type of cusisine would be either sushi or pizza. I say sushi because it's amazing, and I don't get to have it every oftern. When I do get it I get as much sushi as I can possibly it.
                    I say pizza because there are so many different types of pizza that it's (almost) impossible to get sick of eating pizza.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: What's your favorite way to unwind after a hectic day?</h3>
                <p>A: As of right now (April 2024) I am in college, so my favorite why to unwind is to either go to sleep or play video games. When it's any time later than 10:00pm CST, I'll just go to sleep. If it's anytime before 9:00pm CST, 
                    I'll play Baldurs Gate 3 on the PC and I would highly recommend the game.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: What book or movie left a lasting impression on you?</h3>
                <p>A: The book or movie that left a lasting impression of me was the Dr. Suess book, "Oh, the Places You'll Go!". Although this is a childs book, the underlying message is a great one. 
                    This book was read to me on my last day of my Biotechnology class Senior year in 2023. I would highly recommend this book for those who haven't read this book. And for those have read this book, I recommend to reread this book.</p>

            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: How do you define success in life?</h3>
                <p>A: To me, the definition of success in life is righteously furthering your family tree, and A, being a memory for your kids, and B, teaching as much as you can to upcoming generations. While doing this you mustn't let anger rule your life.
                    You are doing something wrong if you are letting a little hiccup in your day define the rest of it. You solely have the power to make or break your day.</p>

            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: What kind of music do you enjoy?</h3>
                <p>A: I enjoy all kinds of music. In a single car with me, the genres could easily range from Heavy Metal to Jazz, and/or Country to Rap. Normally it depends on the mood I am in at the time. Currently (April 2024),I have been listen to the artist
                    Tyler Childers. My favorite of his have been: "Feathered Indians", "Whitehouse Road", "Nose on the Grindstone", and "Shake the Frost (Live)".</p>

            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: What important lessons has life taught you?</h3>
                <p>A: One of the most important lessons that I have been taught is funny enough from Oogway of Kung Fu Panda. Oogway and Po are talking during the conversation he says, "Yesterday is history, Tomorrow is a mystery, but Today is a gift. 
                    That is why it is called the present". When I was younger I didnt know what that meant. But with the new release of Kung Fu Panda 4, I have come to realize how important the saying is.</p>

            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: How important is family to you?</h3>
                <p>A: Family is very important to every person. Not having a supportive family can rally help break your future. Not having a dad at home means you dont have someone to teach you to live on your own, and that important figure for discipline.
                    On the flip side, not having a mom at home means you dont have someone to love and nurture you. Grant it, you can get by in life not having one, but it makes it more difficult.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: Are you a morning or night person?</h3>
                <p>A: I believe I am much more of a night person. Funny enough as I am writting this it is 12:05 CST. One of the reasons I believe I am most definitely not a morning person could be an undiagnosed Sleep Apnea condition. Which makes it harder
                    for me to wake up in the morning.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: What's your dream job?</h3>
                <p>A: My dream job would a Software Developer at Google, Apple, or Amazon making more than 500 thousand dollars a year. But more realisticly it would be whatever job allows me to support my future family.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: Do I have any siblings</h3>
                <p>A: Yes, I have two siblings. My Sister Aurora, and my brother Bryton. I am the oldest out of us three.</p>

            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: Do you enjoy spending time outdoors?</h3>
                <p>A: I love spending time outside. Nature can be very calm and soothing. When I visit places like that I like to sit and just stare at the trees and/or water.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="QAs">
                <h3>Q: Whats something you love learning about?</h3>
                <p>A: I love learning about the current medical advance and the new discoveries in physics. While going through this last semester I was wanting to switch majors after my Associates degree to either a biotechnology field or a physics field.</p>
